            <h2>A brief summary of Netaji's journey</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>
                Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in
                Cuttack—in
                what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in
                British India.
                Prabhavati, or familiarly Mā jananī (lit. 'mother'), the anchor of family life, had her first child at
                age 14
                and 13 children thereafter. Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son. Jankinath, a successful lawyer
                and government
                pleader, was loyal to the government of British India and scrupulous about matters of language and the
                law.
                self-made man from the rural outskirts of Calcutta,
                he had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his village during the pooja holidays.

            <h3>1937–1940: Indian National Congress</h3>
            <p>
                In 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC "should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front
                with the
                two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime."By 1938
                Bose had
                become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President. He stood for
                unqualified Swaraj
                (self-governance), including the use of force against the British. This meant a confrontation
                with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency, splitting the Indian National Congress
                party.

            <h3>1941: Escape to Nazi Germany</h3>
            <p>
                Bose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and
                the Soviet Union.
                few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and
                grew a beard.
                Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long coat, a black
                fez-type coat and
                broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin
                Road house in

                Calcutta on the night of 17 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, later reaching
                Gomoh
                Railway Station (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh Station) in the then state of Bihar (now
                Jharkhand), India.

            <h3>1943–1945: Japanese-occupied Asia</h3>
            <p>
                After a series of protests, India's independence was inevitable.
                The Government of India Act (1935) surrendered significant amounts of power to Indians, and the Indian
                National Congress clamoured for more.
                But after World War II Muslim League demanded that a separate state be created for India's Muslims, and
                to Gandhi's great distress, the Congress leaders agreed.
                In August 1947, India was finally independent, not as a whole but divided into two countries, India and
                Pakistan.

            <h3>18 August 1945: Death</h3>
            <p>
                Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred from third-degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded
                Japanese
                plane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan). However, many among his supporters,
                especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the
                circumstances
                of his death. Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of
                his death and have thereafter had a long shelf life, keeping alive various martial myths about Bose.

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>
                A famous quote was Dilli Chalo ("On to Delhi)!"
                This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate
                them. Another slogan coined by him was "Ittehad, Etemad, Qurbani" (Urdu for "Unity, Agreement,
                Sacrifice").
                Bose was featured on the stamps in India from 1964, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2016, 2018 and 2021. Bose was also
                featured
                in ₹2 coins in 1996 and 1997, ₹75 coin in 2018 and ₹125 coin in 2021. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
                International Airport at Kolkata, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, formerly Ross Island and many
                other institutions
                in India are named after him. On 23 August 2007, Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe visited the Netaji
                Bhawan in Kolkata.
                Abe, who is also the recipient of Netaji Award 2022, said to Bose's family "The Japanese are deeply
                moved by Bose's strong

                will to have led the Indian independence movement from British rule. Netaji is a much respected name in
                Japan.
